## Overarching structure of the program(s)

- Use PCA or similar to get the most significant frequencies of the image.

- Choose a specific amount of frequencies for each image to get an acceptable error

- Fuse the images into one

## Questions 

- How do we actually fuse the images? What happens if we get the same frequencies but in different places in the images?

- How do we match the images? What kind of technique or function can you use that fulfills the requirements?

- Do we need to pick frequencies that occur in both images only or can we have one that is not present in the other?
